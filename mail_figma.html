Subject: Sponsorship Request: AI-Driven OS/Browser Development by Arivell - [Your Name]

Dear Figma, Inc. Team,

My name is [あなたの氏名], and I am the representative of Arivell, a programming team based in Japan. We're currently working on an ambitious open-source project to develop a custom operating system, web browser, and JavaScript engine from scratch, leveraging advanced technologies like AI and low-level system programming.

For this project, the Figma Professional full sheet is absolutely essential. It's crucial for designing the sophisticated UI/UX of our OS desktop environment and web browser, and for enabling seamless collaborative design within the Arivell team.

We are seeking your sponsorship to cover the annual cost of the Figma Professional full sheet, which is approximately 28,800 JPY (around $182 USD, based on $1 = 158 JPY).

Figma is the industry standard for UI/UX design, and its intuitive nature and powerful collaboration features are indispensable for managing the complex design challenges of our project. By supporting Arivell, Figma, Inc. would gain:

A Cutting-Edge Use Case for Figma: Our project, developing an OS and browser, presents a unique and highly complex design challenge. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase how Figma can be a powerful design platform even for such groundbreaking and low-level engineering efforts.
Promotion of Design and Engineering Integration: Our project strongly emphasizes the seamless integration of design and engineering. Figma's central role in this process will highlight how your product is indispensable for the future of creative engineering.
Support for Young Creators and Engineers: By empowering a young team like ours, you contribute directly to nurturing the next generation of creative and engineering talent, aligning with your company's social responsibility initiatives.
Expanded Influence within the Student Community: Our work can inspire other students to explore complex system design with Figma, thereby expanding your reach within the student and developer communities.

Please note, as a middle school student leading this project, I have obtained my guardian's consent for financial management and any contractual agreements. My guardian is prepared to collaborate throughout any discussions and formal procedures.

Sincerely,

[あなたの氏名]
Representative, Arivell
